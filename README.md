![GSoC 2021](https://img.shields.io/badge/GSoC-2021-green.svg)

Cardie is a multi-protocol chat program based on [Caya](https://github.com/Augustolo/Caya).

It can use native protocol add-ons and protocols supported by libpurple, the
library used by [Pidgin](https://pidgin.im/).

Protocols natively supported are:
- IRC
- XMPP

Protocols generally supported through libpurple include GroupWise, Zephyr, and
[others through plugins](https://pidgin.im/plugins/?type=Protocol).

## Building
You can make Cardie and its protocols with:

`$ make`

Or one-by-one:

`$ make libs; make app; make protocols`

Cardie itself requires the `expat_devel` package, the XMPP protocol requires
`gloox_devel`, and the libpurple add-on requires `libpurple_devel` and
`glib2_devel`â€• though it's worth noting that libpurple doesn't work on x86_gcc2.


## License
Cardie itself is under the MIT license, but licenses vary for the included
libraries and add-ons.

The `xmpp` and `purple` add-ons are under the GPLv2+, and `irc` the MIT license.

`libsupport` is under the MIT license, though containing some PD code.
`librunview` contains code from Vision, and is under the MPL.
`libinterface` is under the MIT license.
